        # E006: Line longer than 79 columns (as many scripts use jinja
        #       templating, this is very difficult)
        # E040: Syntax error determined using `bash -n` (as many scripts
        #       use jinja templating, this will often fail and the syntax
        #       error will be discovered in execution anyway)
